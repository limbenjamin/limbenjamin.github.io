</p><p>Image from wikipedia</p>
</p><p>Artificial intelligence refers to “the idea of making computers and
machinery think, learn and even correct itself from its own mistakes”1.
Hence, from the definition, we can immediately grasp the potential
benefits of having AI be involved in the decision making process. While
the AI might not be infallible, its ability to learn coupled with its
permanent memory means that the decisions it makes will get better over
time. For extremely complex decisions with many factors and
repercussions to consider, a computer would be capable of making a far
more rational and calculated decision compared to a human. However, is
it ethical to allow AI to make decision for us? Would you accept
national policies that are formulated by a computer?</p>
<p>In this post, I wish to explore if it is ethical to involve current AI
technology in decision making processes particularly in the field of
medicine and law. As such, I am not interested in a fantasy world where
robots have colonized the earth and enslaved humans. I am also not
interested in future AI technology that have far surpassed the human
brain and can formulate perfect ethical theories which the human brain
is incapable of finding any fault with. Therefore, I would be using
existing ethical theories to evaluate the use of current AI technology.</p>
<p>Medicine is an extremely complicated field of study largely due to the
complexity of the human body. Among doctors, there are specialists who
specialize in the treatment of certain conditions such as cardiologists
who specialize in conditions to do with the heart and pediatricians who
specialize in ailments affecting children. Even among specialists, there
are doctors who specialize even further, e.g. pediatric cardiologists,
and even among them, there are a few who specialize in certain rare
diseases that affect 1 in a million people. Making their job harder,
symptoms such as nausea and dizziness can actually result from many
diseases from all specializations,they may not be the typical symptoms
seen in that particular disease, it might even be caused by two
unrelated diseases. Suffice to say, misdiagnoses is unavoidable as it is
impossible for doctors to know everything in the medical field.</p>
<p>In such a situation, AI has the advantage due to its practically
unlimited and perfect memory. It can store information on all diseases
known to mankind, provide statistics on how common the diseases are, all
the various symptoms that might be exhibited. Using AI to diagnose a
disease, the computer can rank the various disease according to
likelihood based on symptoms described. It can even personalise
diagnosis based on factors such as race, age, weight, family history and
genetics to determine if a certain disease might be more likely. Lastly
and most importantly, AI has the ability to learn from past diagnoses,
keeping accurate statistics which helps to provide even more accurate
diagnoses in the future. In short, it is leaps and bounds better than
the current system. However, we do face certain ethical issues when AI
is used in diagnoses of illnesses.</p>
<p>The first such issue is doctor patient confidentiality. Such an
arrangement is crucial because it allows for trust between the doctor
and patient. The patient can thus divulge personal information without
the fear of being judged, allowing for more accurate diagnoses. If AI is
being used in the diagnoses process, patient information has to be
shared in order for the AI to learn from past diagnoses, therefore
compromising the arrangement. Information can be anonymised, however
doing so would reduce the amount the system can learn from it. There is
also no guarantee that anonymised data cannot be traced back to the
patient. Lastly, if it was discovered that the diagnosis was wrong, it
might not be able to trace back to the patient to rectify the mistake.</p>
<p>The next issue facing AI technology is the problem of misdiagnoses.
Especially in the early trials of the system, due to the lack of
statistical information, the system might not be as accurate. Which
party should then be deemed responsible for the misdiagnoses? All
fingers might point to the programmer first, however we must realize
that the system is designed to learn from past diagnoses, as such it is
not designed to be correct 100% of the time. Especially when the issue
might result in life and death circumstances, is it ethical to let
patients pay the price of a mistake made by a machine? Of course, we can
allow doctors to override the diagnosis made by the AI. However, doctors
are also not right 100% of the time, if the doctor was wrong, we would
be “teaching” the AI the wrong thing, which increases the likelihood of
all future diagnosis to be wrong.</p>
<p>Using utilitarian methods to examine the issue of using AI in medical
diagnosis, benefits would include much more accurate diagnosis of
diseases in the long run. Costs would include the potential loss of
confidentiality of medical condition as well as the possibility of
misdiagnoses especially in the short run. I believe that the benefits
outweigh the cost but most of the benefits can only be realised in the
long term while most of the costs are short term. It is also difficult
to quantify the costs since the misdiagnoses could result in aggravation
of condition or even death. Therefore, there is a huge disparity in the
distribution of benefits and costs. While everyone wants to enjoy better
diagnosis in the future, no one is willing to be the guinea pig to allow
the AI to practice on them.</p>
<p>Using the second formulation of Kantian ethics to analyse the situation,
by using the patients data to improve its diagnoses, the AI is using the
patients as a means to an end. However, Kantian ethics does not take
into account the fact that the AI is doing so to provide even greater
accuracy for future diagnosis, which would ultimately benefit patients.
Using the first formulation, if AI gave out wrong diagnoses, people
would gradually stop trusting the AI and revert back to doctors.
Therefore, nobody would go to the AI for diagnoses and the AI would be
unable to give out wrong diagnoses anymore. Therefore, using AI for
diagnoses is unethical when analyzed using the Kantian perspective.</p>
<p>In order for a move to using AI to increase the accuracy of diagnoses.
Certain societal and legal changes might have to be made. Patient doctor
confidentiality might have to be sacrificed. Society also has to accept
the fact that the AI is not perfect and learns from its mistakes.
Perhaps change has to be implemented incrementally, with AI assisting
doctors in diagnoses during early years and slowly transiting towards
fully automating the diagnosis process.</p>
<p>Next, I would like to consider the ethicality of using AI in the
decision making process of our justice system.I would be considering the
use of AI only for the process of deciding the length of the sentence,
and not the entire judicial process. Our current justice system requires
judges to take into consideration a lot of factors such as the
circumstances in which the crime was committed, the motive for
committing the crime, the attributes of the crime, before passing a
sentence based on prevailing laws as a guideline. Even then, the legal
system is often caught up in endless appeal cases which consume lots of
time and resources.</p>
<p>As with any other human involved in a decision making process, it is
often difficult to be impartial to a certain situation. One tends to
bring in personal morals and values when making such decisions. This
might ultimately lead to unfairness during sentencing when certain
judges might dish out heavier punishments than others for specific types
of crimes. An AI system would solve this situation using a utilitarian
approach. By assigning values to the certain factors involved, the
system would be able to calculate the degree to which the accused is
guilty and sentence him accordingly. This system would also be much
fairer as another person who committed the exact same crime in the exact
same circumstances would get the same punishment. Lastly, since the
outcome is always the same, the entire appeal process can be done away
with.</p>
<p>Such a system definitely sound good in theory. It does indeed provide
greater degree of fairness during sentencing. However, careful planning
is necessary as the system will need to make important decisions such as
the value of certain factors involved in the case. In short, the task of
weighing the factors has never been taken away, it has just been
transferred from the judge to the system. The AI system will then use
these exact same values to judge all other cases, thus ensuring
impartial sentencing. Nevertheless, it might be difficult to assign
values to certain factors, especially when human life might be at stake.</p>
<p>The next potential issue that the system might face is the ethicality of
allowing a machine to play the role of god. Currently, there are already
people who feel that a judge, being human, should not be given the power
to decide whether someone lives or not. By bringing the power of
decision down to a mere machine, we are further marring the sanctity of
life itself, demoting it to a value which is decided by a machine. Has
human life become such a commodity?</p>
<p>As technology advances, a greater degree of automation can be provided
by machines for increasingly complex tasks. From simple tasks such as
assembly line automation, to complicated tasks such as market analysis,
computers have largely either replaced or assisted humans greatly. To
date however, some of the most complex tasks such as diagnosis and
sentencing are still largely performed by humans. Nevertheless, it has
been shown that AI has the ability to perform these tasks with greater
efficiency and impartiality as compared to humans. We have already begun
on the slippery slope of allowing computers to take over our daily
tasks. If we do not set our boundaries, we would very soon be sliding
further and further down. We might one day wake up to machines
controlling every aspect of our lives.</p>
