        <p>Disclaimer: My previous employer is a subsidiary of SingTel and I have
vested interest in SingTel since I own 0.00000000001% of SingTel.
Nevertheless, I will try to be as impartial as possible.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="http://shanghaiist.com/attachments/tiffanyap/broadband.jpg" /></p>

</p><p>The first issue I would like to examine is the ethicality of
misrepresentation of broadband speeds. Most people would encounter such
a situation when despite signing up for 6Mbps broadband, you discover
that your downloads never inch past 500KBps. I know that there are a
myriad of reasons such as overhead of TCP protocol, bottleneck on the
server side and the most obvious one that people don’t seem to realise.
ISPs use Megabits/sec as an indicator while your downloads use
KiloBytes/sec or MegaBytes/sec as an indicator. There are 8 bits in a
byte so your actual download speed is actually 4000Kilobits/sec of 4
Megabits/sec, 66% of advertised speed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will not be focusing on those issues as those are beyond the
control of the ISP. Instead I will be focusing on the issue of ISPs
knowingly offering less than advertised broadband speed. What happens
when you sign up for a 6Mbps ADSL connection is that you get the 6Mbps
connection all the way to an intermediate point known as a DSLAM. The
DSLAM aggregates all the traffic and transmit it in 1 single pipe to the
exchange. Therefore, during peak periods, the bandwidth of the DSLAM
might not be sufficient to handle the traffic, therefore resulting in a
bottleneck. Assuming that the DSLAM can handle 600Mbps of traffic, is it
ethical then to connect more than 100 subscribers to the same DSLAM?</p>
<p>Using utilitarian ethics, the ISP will definitely benefit as they are
able to cram more subscribers into current infrastructure, thus the cost
of providing an additional subscriber with access is almost zero. Would
the subscribers benefit? My opinion is yes. Since not everyone is using
the full 6Mbps of the connection 24/7, subscribers generally have
optimal connection most of the time except during peak hours, when
connection speed might drop. In return, the ISP is actually charging us
a far lower price than the true cost of providing 6Mbps internet. Go
look up the cost of a dedicated lease line if you don’t believe me. A
dedicated line would guarantee the full 6Mbps any time of the day since
you are connected directly to the exchange and not sharing the line with
anybody. Therefore, according to utilitarian ethics, such a practice is
ethical since both parties benefit from such an arrangement.</p>
<p>From the Kantian point of view, it is unethical if we were to apply the
first formulation. If everyone lied, no one would trust anyone else and
therefore it would be impossible to lie, which would contradict the
original statement. Using the second formulation, we discover that the
ISP is treating the subscribers as a means to an end, using subscribers
for their own profit and not fulfilling their part of the agreement.
Therefore, it is unethical if analysed using Kantian ethics.</p>
<p>Using the ACM code of conduct to evaluate the issue, we find that the
issue contravenes clause 1.3 but supports clause 2.1. Such an action is
not honest or trustworthy as it involves deceiving the subscriber by
providing less than advertised broadband speed during peak periods.
However, through the deceit, the ISP is able to provide customers with a
higher quality connection at a lower price, therefore it is in support
of clause 2.1 which advocates highest quality and effectiveness in your
products.</p>
<p>Such is the limitation of Kantian ethics; it allows for no exceptions to
be made to its perfect duties regardless of circumstances. Even though
the ISP has deceived its subscribers, the subscribers are actually
benefiting since they are able to get a better connection most of the
time at a much lower price. If the ISP had not done so, it would either
have had to offer a much lower speed for the same price. This would
result in huge underutilisation of the infrastructure during non-peak
hours, during which subscribers would still be capped by their low
download speeds despite there being additional capacity on the network.</p>
<p>As for me, I have learnt to schedule heavy usage during non-peak periods
and am glad to have light users subsidise the cost of providing me with
a good internet connection. So far, I have not experienced problems with
basic browsing during peak periods as the ISPs has set into place QoS
filters that prioritise web traffic over P2P downloads. The complainers
are usually the ones who choose to download during peak periods. Such
situations can easily be avoided with a little time management. If you
do however insist on having no less than the speed you paid for, feel
free to pay the true costs of such a connection by subscribing for a
dedicated line, the ISPs even provide a Service Level Agreement(SLA), so
technically you could sue them for compensation if your connection does
meet the standards specified. As for me a shared connection is enough
for my needs.</p>
<p>In short, the issue is ethical if we analyse the outcome but unethical
if we analyse the intentions. Nevertheless, I believe that since
subscribers benefit even though they were deceived, the end outcome is
still positive.</p>

</p><p>The next issue I would like to analyse is the ethicality of over
utilisation of 3G networks. Most of us are familiar with the situation
especially in recent years before the introduction of 4G, when 3G speeds
all over the island practically slowed to a crawl. Is it ethical for
Telcos to continue to sign up new subscribers for these networks without
upgrading the infrastructure to support a greater number of connections?</p>
<p>Analysing the issue from a business standpoint, it is definitely a bad
business decision to invest in 3G infrastructure especially with 4G
looming around the corner, as it is soon to be obsolete and the rate of
returns on investment is very likely to be low. It also increases the
disincentives for subscribers to switch over to the 4G network since 3G
networks are perfectly capable of satisfying their requirements.
Nevertheless, the question exists if Telcos should still continue to
sign up subscribers. Since the cost of providing service to 1 additional
user is marginal, there is no incentive for Telcos not to sign up new
subscribers. However, since the networks are very likely to be
oversaturated, subscribers may be experiencing speeds that are far less
than advertised.</p>
<p>From the utilitarian perspective, the Telcos stand to benefit from the
increase in revenue generated from the increase in number of
subscribers. The subscribers may gripe about the issue but often have
little choice as the problem may be rampant among the 3 Telcos. In
addition, subscribers are often tied into contracts of 1-2 years,
therefore it might not be possible for them to switch Telcos
immediately. However, this benefit comes at a cost to the subscribers.
They have to endure sub-par service standards as a result. In such a
case, I believe the costs of intermittent internet access outweigh the
savings enjoyed by the Telcos. Such an action is thus unethical when
analysed using the utilitarian methodology.</p>
<p>One limitation of the utilitarian method is that it only takes into
account the total good, but does not factor in unequal distribution of
the benefits. In the case above, while the Telcos benefit a lot from
such an action, the subscribers on the other hand, experience large
amount of inconvenience and frustration. This does not seem fair as the
subscribers are the ones who have paid the Telcos for the provision of
the service. It is also extremely difficult to quantify the costs of the
poor 3G speeds for the subscriber, as such it is extremely difficult to
make an accurate prediction on the actual costs incurred.</p>
<p>Using the Kantian approach, we can conclude that the action is unethical
using the second formulation. The Telcos are exploiting the subscribers
and using them as a means to generate profit while not providing them
with an acceptable standard of service. Using the first formulation, we
can derive that if all Telcos were to oversaturate their 3G networks,
subscribers might get so annoyed that they choose to forgo 3G data. In
such a case, it would be impossible to oversaturate the infrastructure
since there are no longer any subscribers, contradicting the first
statement. Nevertheless, such a statement is rather extreme. In reality,
while some subscribers might choose to forgo 3G altogether, there are
others who would not be able to live without it. As a result,
subscription for 3G might dip slightly, just enough for the
infrastructure to be able to handle. This would once again contradict
the first statement as it would prove impossible to oversaturate the
infrastructure</p>
<p>Therefore, using both the utilitarian and the Kantian method, I have
deduced that oversaturation of 3G infrastructure in a bid to save costs
is unethical. In reality however, Telcos might still choose the
unethical option due to profit motives. As highlighted earlier, the
Telcos do have an edge over the subscribers since subscribers are often
bound by their contracts. In addition, if all the Telcos adopt the same
strategy, subscribers often have no choice but to accept their terms or
go without 3G data.</p>
