        <p><img alt="image0" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTliWIP6fiRJ7raMQVw7OJHcIE5xjR5UV50jcZxsBcZVlxFfUPUblYFutPHkQ" /></p>
<p>Firstly, I wish to define abandonware as &quot;software that is ostensibly
still protected by copyright, but is no longer being supported or
marketed&quot; provided by Technopedia<sup>1</sup>. As such, my article will
focus on the possible ethical issues companies and consumers might face
when products are transiting from software to abandonware. I will
provide examples of a few real life cases and evaluate if these actions
are ethical and what considerations they might have taken into account
when making these decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="Full-size image (23 K)" src="http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0094576509005165-gr3.jpg" /></p>
<p>In order to evaluate the transition from software to abandonware, we
must first examine a typical product lifecycle and determine which stage
in its lifecycle is the transition most likely to fall in. As shown in
the graph above by Perrault, William D. Jr<sup>2</sup>,the decline stage
is where sales and profits reaped from a particular product plummets. It
is also likely to be the stage where the transition occurs since the
company is only earning minimal profits from the product, however,
maintenance cost for the product is likely to have remained and thus
continuing support for the product would be a loss making decision.
Although the company might not have discontinued support for the
product, they might choose to allocate less of their budget to
maintaining the product and instead focus on the development of a new
product.</p>
<p>Windows 7 from Microsoft is an example of such a product that has
entered this transition phase. As Microsoft focuses more on development
of Windows 8, it is scaling down on maintenance of Windows 7. This is
especially evident in the case of the bug that allows IPv6 Router
Advertisement flooding to cause denial of service (DoS) in Windows 7
client. The severity of the bug is described here<sup>3</sup>.In short, a
simple tool used to spam ICMPv6 Router Advertisement requests would
cause all clients running Windows 7, Vista, XP,&nbsp; Windows server 2003 and
2008 in the same subnet to be inundated with requests, resulting a
drastic increase in CPU usage and even causing the PC to crash. This
issue was highlighted to Microsoft on the 10 July 2010 and Microsoft
responded on 12 August 2010 that although they acknowledged the
vulnerability, they had no intention of providing any fix to the
problem<sup>4</sup>, despite the fact that support for Windows XP is
slated to end only in 2014 and Windows 7 only in 2020.</p>
<p>Looking at the issue from an act utilitarian standpoint, fixing the bug
will entail minimal costs to Microsoft as it requires only a few lines
of code to modify the behaviour of&nbsp; the operating system to ignore all
remaining router advertisements for a period of time when dealt with a
flood of router advertisements. Costs would also be incurred due to the
usage of bandwidth to push down the updates to all clients. The
negligible costs will definitely be dwarfed by the benefits due to the
severity of the bug, in which one malicious user could crash more than
200 clients on the same subnet, resulting in loss of productivity and
profits as entire web servers might be taken down.</p>
<p>Taking a Kantian approach, if we apply the first formulation, we would
try to analyse what would occur if all software companies decided not to
provide support for their products once they transit toward abandonware.
Consumers will no longer have any trust in companies and may start
turning towards open source software as these are maintained by people
who are driven by passion instead of monetary incentives. As a result,
commercial software would cease to exist as there is no longer any
demand for it. Using the second formulation, we can deduce that the
companies are simply using consumers as a means to an end, once the bulk
of the profit has been made, the company ceases to care about the
consumers who made that profit possible in the first place. Therefore,
using both utilitarian and Kantian approaches to analyse the issue, I
have come to the conclusion that such an action is unethical.</p>
<p>However, one might argue that according to virtue ethics, Microsoft's
actions are ethical as long as the organization itself is ethical.
Microsoft was awarded the 'Most Ethical' award by ethisphere for the
year 2011<sup>5</sup>. This was largely due to the millions in donations
to non-profit organisations and infrastructural investments in less
developed countries. Assuming that the motives behind these
contributions are indeed ethical, it is still a fallacy to conclude that
since some of its actions are ethical, therefore it as an entity must be
ethical and therefore all its actions are ethical.</p>
<p>In addition to being unethical, such an action is also unprofessional.
Using the ACM code of conduct as a guideline<sup>6</sup>, this action
violates clause 2.6 and 1.2 to name a few. By refusing to provide a fix
for a bug that has serious ramifications on current software that is
purportedly still supported, Microsoft has not honoured its assigned
responsibilities. Before buying a product, a consumer takes into
consideration the fact that Microsoft would continue to update its
product to patch security and functional flaws until the end of its
shelf life. The consumer is not expecting new features or functions but
merely to fix problems that may have been undetected during the test
phase. IPv6 was a feature included during the launch of Windows 7 and
thus, Microsoft's refusal to fix a bug of an included feature is
unprofessional. Microsoft also has to responsibility to prevent harm to
users of its software to the best of its ability. Despite having been
warned and acknowledging the vulnerability, Microsoft chose not to take
any action that could potentially prevent harm to users of its software,
therefore violating clause 1.2.</p>
<p>So why has Microsoft chosen not to fix the bug even though it is
unethical and unprofessional? One of the major reasons is due to profit
motive, although the cost of fixing the bug is minimal, fixing the bug
will reduce the incentive for customers to upgrade to Windows 8. This is
because their current version of Windows is secure and functional, thus
there is less need to upgrade. However, if there are major issues with
security and functionality, a customer might be left with no choice but
to upgrade. However, this strategy might backfire as customers might
instead switch to different operating system such as Linux as they might
see the same issue affecting Windows 8 when Microsoft releases Windows
9.</p>
<p>Fortunately, NUS DHCP servers distribute IPv4 addresses as shown by the
screenshot below. Nevertheless, the computers below were all connected
to the same subnet and thus could potentially be vulnerable to the
abovementioned exploit if they are running Windows 7 or XP, if NUS

<p>With that, I wish to move on to the second ethical concern regarding the
transition from software to abandonware. Is it ethical to pirate
abandonware? For this argument, I wish to focus on abandonware for which
the manufacturing company is still in business today and has not decided
to make the software freely available to the public. The reason being,
if the company is out of business, the case becomes very clear that the
pirating the software would only bring about benefits as there are
simply no costs to consider using a utilitarianism approach. Using a
Kantian approach, we are not using anyone as a means to an end since the
entity which owns the copyright has ceased to exist. Lastly, if the
software is made freely available to the public, it is now classified as
freeware and is thus out of the scope specified. Back to the topic, the
ethicality of pirating abandonware which is still owned by a company is
interesting as the software is still under copyright protection and thus
it is illegal in most cases. Nevertheless, I wish to explore if the law
in this instance reflects the ethicality of the situation.</p>
<p>The software I would like to examine is Windows 2000. Windows 2000 was
released at the turn of the millennium and support for the product
ceased in 2010<sup>7</sup>.Therefore, as of now, Microsoft provides no
service to anyone that is currently using Windows 2000 and incurs no
cost in further development or maintenance of the software. However, the
software is still under copyright in most countries with copyright only
expiring only in 2070 to 2120 depending on individual countries.</p>
<p>Using the utilitarian method to approach this issue, the benefits of
pirating the product are that it allows many poorer countries access to
computers and the internet at a cheaper price as a greater proportion of
the budget can now be channelled into provision of the hardware. While
it lacks many features, it is still able to handle basic tasks such as
web browsing and data entry and storage which would be invaluable to
these users. It also benefits computing students who can now obtain a
copy to learn more about how an operating system is written through
reverse engineering. However, detractors might argue that Microsoft is a
losing party as it has spent a lot on the development of the software
and thus it needs to recoup those losses. It is worth pointing out
though that Microsoft has stopped offering these products for sale many
years ago, therefore, it has no means to recoup any costs even if the
software was not pirated. Since support for the product has also ceased,
Microsoft also does not face additional costs if one additional person
were to use the software. In short, the benefits outweigh the cost
because even if there was cost involved, Microsoft is making no attempts
to recover it.</p>
<p>Using the second formulation of Kantian ethics however, it is unethical
because we are using Microsoft as a means to an end. In order to get
access to their software without paying, we are pirating a copy.
However, the limitation to using Kantian ethics is that such a statement
might not fully represent the various aspects of the situation. It does
not take into the account the fact that the piracy is meant for
educational purposes, nor does it take into account the fact that the
company is not in any way harmed by such an action. Nevertheless some
might argue that a certain group of users might find that Windows 2000
might be able to completely satisfy their computing requirements and
therefore see no purpose in buying the current version of Windows. My
response to that is the group of users is very small at best, and the
effect is marginal. In fact, Microsoft might even benefit from such an
action because it increases its market share and awareness, quite
possibly, it might even influence these users to purchase Microsoft
products in the future.</p>
<p>In summary, although piracy of abandonware is largely illegal in most
countries, I believe that the practice is not unethical due to the
arguments presented above. In fact, the &quot;victim&quot; of such a piracy might
even benefit in certain cases. Fortunately, most companies do realise
that and even though they have the right to prosecute users who pirate
abandonware, they seldom do so in reality.</p>
