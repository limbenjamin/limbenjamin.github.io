        <p>**Project Reports for nusmods**</p>
<p>This project is done at the Vostok (beginner) level.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
</p><div class="section" id="first-report-week-3">
<h2>First Report (Week 3)</h2>
</p><p>The aim of the project is to develop a platform which will allow NUS
students to easily retrieve prerequisites and preclusions of modules
offered by NUS. The motivation to do so is because the current system
offered by NUS is not as user friendly, especially for bulk retrieval of
information for several modules. We have targeted 2 platforms to develop
for, namely, a web application as well as an android application. We
would be using Google Datastore for storage and other platforms will
access the data through a REST interface.</p>
<p>The main features in the website are the table mode, graph mode and REST
interface. The table mode allows users to view information of multiple
modules in a single table. The graph mode allows them to manually map
out a dependency graph of their modules. The REST interface allows other
developers to make use of all module information that we have already
preloaded into our database.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
</p></div>
<div class="section" id="second-report-week-8">
<h2>Second Report (Week 8)</h2>
</p><p>Over the last couple of weeks, we have managed to successfully implement
all features that were proposed.The features are as follows:</p>
<p>1.Beautifying the UI of the android app - The UI has been improved to
include instructions and boxes for neater display of content, the submit
button has also been enlarged so it is easier for users to hit it.
Screenshots available at
<a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limbenjamin.nusmods">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limbenjamin.nusmods</a>. The
screenshots are pretty self explanatory in case you are not using
android or do not want to install the app.</p>
<p>2.Tidying up the code (currently most of the code is hacked together) -
Most of the excess code for functions not being used has been stripped,
query has been parameterised to improve on security.</p>
<p>3.Share on facebook/twitter functionality - Can be observed on main
site.</p>
<p>Reponse to feedback</p>
<p>Changing name because there is an existing nusmods.com - We will retain
the URL nusmods.appspot.com but our page title and page name will be
named &quot;NUS Modules&quot; to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Putting table at side of graph- We have added a feature so that when you
hover your mouse over a module, the prerequisites will show in a popup
bubble</p>
<p>Additionally, we have also added in instructions throughout the website
to guide users. Pictures in the banner to show users what they can
expect. We have also added in additional data on which semester a module
is offered as feedbacked.</p>
<p>For the next sprint, we will working on the following three features:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Allowing users to export the table/graph as csv/jpg</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Improving the UI of the graph page</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Script to automate process of updating module information</p>
<p>User Stories</p>
<p>Feature 1: A year 1 arts student has spent the last 30 minutes graphing
out her modules and wants to save it for future reference. She is not
familiar with computers and does not know how to use the print screen
function.</p>
<p>Feature 2: A year 2 new media student wants a nicer looking graph page
than the current drab grey coloured page.</p>
<p>Feature 3: The developers of this app do not want to spend the rest of
their time in NUS updating modules and want a script which will automate
the process.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
</p></div>
<div class="section" id="final-report-week-12">
<h2>Final Report (Week 12)</h2>
</p><p>We have sucessfully implemented all the features that were targeted in
the previous sprint. Video can be found
[here](<a class="reference external" href="http://limbenjamin.com/video3.mp4">http://limbenjamin.com/video3.mp4</a>)</p>
<p>1) Allowing users to export the table/graph as csv/jpg - instead of csv
for the table and jpg for the image, we have implemented export to xls
for table and png for image due to exising libraries which are already
present for the file formats. Unfortunately, there are a few security
features triggered which might inconvenience users, excel 2013 would
display a warning that the file might be unsafe and chrome will block
the image popup.</p>
<p>2) Improving the UI of the graph page - The prerequisite popup bubble
has been styled to look nicer, users have the option to toggle between
white, red, green or blue background color for the module by double
clicking on it. Colors can be used to differentiate between core and
electives, or users can come up with their own color scheme, e.g.
different colors for different level modules.</p>
<p>3) Script to automate process of updating module information - The
script to download and parse module information from IVLE website has
been completed and uploaded <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/limbenjamin/modulescrapper">here</a>. This script will generate a CSV
file which is ready for upload to GAE using the bulkloader. We did not
automate the uploading because of the amount of information will
definitely exceed the daily upload quota.</p>
<p>No additional work was done on the android app for this sprint.</p>
<p>Initial aim : Vostok</p>
<p>Current Estimated level : Gemini</p>
<p>List of features implemented:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Display of module information in table form</li>
<li>Manually graph out module prerequisites</li>
<li>API to allow other other developers to access database</li>
<li>Android app to access module information</li>
<li>Social media integration</li>
<li>Export information as xls and png</li>
<li>Shell script to automate updating process</li>
</ul>
<p>We intended to automate the graph generation but eventually decided not
to implement it because parsing the prerequisites might introduce
errors. E.g. instead of module A AND B, our parser might interpret it as
module A OR B. This would be disastrous if the user did not double check
and relied solely on our graph.</p>

<div class="section" id="comments-after-reading-evaluator-s-feedback-week-3">
<h2>Comments after reading evaluator's feedback(Week 3)</h2>
</p><p>Firstly, we would like to thank everyone for their time spent reviewing
our application.Points that were raised include</p>
<p>Changing name because there is an existing nusmods.com - We will
consider the suggestion, the main problem faced is that it will take
another 8 days to upload all 10,000 module's information due to daily
quota limits of app engine.</p>
<p>Using webview, or mobile view of website - Our current website is
already optimized for mobile. The reason for having an android app is
due to user story 3, because you might need module information in a
hurry and might not remember the URL for the website. Secondly, the
single module search only is actually a limit that we imposed, reason
being it is meant for quick checking use as described in user story 3
and not for mapping your entire 4 years. I also did not want to clutter
the screen since screen size for mobile devices is quite small.Need not
worry about the time it takes, we need to finds things to fill up 130
hours.</p>
<p>Putting table at side of graph- We have considered it but the main
drawback is that you would have less screen real estate available to do
your graphing. We may implement a popup bubble with prerequisites when
you mouseover the module item.</p>
<p>Better explanations throughout website - We have actually hinted by
placing &quot;CS1010,is1103,EC1301&quot; in the search box to show that multiple
modules are accepted and input is not case sensitive. Nevertheless, we
do acknowledge that the website is very poorly explained because we were
focusing on functionality and making sure everything works.</p>
<p>We will be working on improving the user experience through better
instructions to make sure that users are not confused when using the
website. Xofel has also suggested adding in information on whether a
module is offered during which semester. These 2 features will also be
completed in the next sprint. As for the automated graph, we will be
putting it on hold due to the complexity of the task.</p>

<div class="section" id="comments-after-reading-evaluator-s-feedback-week-8">
<h2>Comments after reading evaluator's feedback(Week 8)</h2>
</p><p>Feedback 1: Students have to first look through the module listing from
school website before entering into NUS modules website.</p>
<p>It will be very convenient if we could just select our major/stream and
have the list of modules automatically loaded. Unfortunately, we do not
know of a website which list all the required modules of all the various
majors/streams from all faculties. It would be too troublesome to search
each faculty's website and manually add in the modules. Furthermore,
certain faculties may not even publish this information on their
websites.</p>
<p>Feedback 2: Location where instructions are placed are normally used for

<p>That is certainly true, we will look into modifying the layout to
accommodate the instructions at a suitable location</p>
<p>Feedback 3: Implement Unit testing</p>
<p>May consider if we have time, but priority is to finish up the features
specified.</p>
<p>Feedback 4: Get non-SOC people to test</p>
<p>We would try approaching a few non-SOC friends to get their feedback on
the app.</p>
<p>Since there is no feedback on the user stories for the next sprint, we
will be retaining it.</p>
<p>Note: The graph feature will continue to be manually drag-and-connect.
Plans to automate it has been shelved because we cannot guarantee its
accuracy to a reasonable level. Users will therefore have to
double-check the generated graph to be safe (or they risk not graduating
on time). There is no point automating the process if you have to
manually double check the results, therefore we have decided not to
implement it.</p>

<div class="section" id="comments-after-reading-evaluator-s-feedback-week-12">
<h2>Comments after reading evaluator's feedback(Week 12)</h2>
</p><p>Feedback 1: Seamless switching between graph and table mode without
re-entry of modules.</p>
<p>Why yes! We are unsure how this managed to escape all our minds for so
long, but this is definitely a very good and useful feature.</p>
<p>Feedback 2: Additional information e.g. timetable schedule, workload</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we feel that this would deviate from the use case of the
app. We intend to provide a way to easily look up and graph
prerequisites for modules. We are not interested in creating a
timetabling app or modules per semester app. By implementing too many
features, it may dilute our core functionality. Others apps out there
serve a very specific purpose as well. E.g. nusmods.com for timetabling,
corspedia for CORS bidding and so on.</p>
<p>Feedback 3: Input format restriction</p>
<p>This is a concern. We will allow space for graph mode. However in the
long run, we are looking are implementing an &quot;autocomplete&quot; type of
dropdown menu so users can select instead of typing out the full module
code. This would hopefully reduce input problems. However, one of the
biggest challenges is that the &quot;autocomplete&quot; list has 10,000+ modules.</p>
<p>Feedback 4: Graph UI improvement</p>
<p>Improving and changing the UI is a continous process that we will be
doing.</p>
<p>Feedback 5: Video</p>
<p>We apologise for the video. What happened was that both of us were very
busy during submission week so we finished the video and wiki 1 week
earlier. We had assumed that the video would be similar to previous
iterations. I.E. less than 3 mins, introducing new features.
Unfortunately, when prof released the details, it was a 5 minute video
about the entire app. By then, we were already too busy and did not have
enough time to redo the video.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all our fellow peer evaluators for their time and
effort reviewing and giving feedback for our app. We have certainly
benefited from the constructive feedback and hope that we have not
fallen short on our evaluation of your apps. We will continue to maintain
this app for the next 6 months. Beyond that, it depends largely on the
amount of traffic. It makes no sense to spend time on a project that is
not utilised. We would rather work on something that is of use to
someone.</p>

<div class="section" id="competitors">
<h2>Competitors</h2>
</p><p>Currently, we see no competitors as we do not know of a web app that
provides similar functionality. The IVLE site provides minimal
competition as the information is scattered and difficult to locate.
Nevertheless, we have taken note that a number of teams in orbital are
embarking on a similar project and might pose competition.</p>

<div class="section" id="stakeholders">
<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
</p><p>NUS students. This app is created for the community and will be provided
free of charge. Students who feel that it is beneficial can choose to
make use of it.</p>

<div class="section" id="external-dependencies">
<h2>External Dependencies</h2>
</p><p>We have scrapped information from over 10000+ modules in IVLE and
uploaded it into the datastore, so there are currently no external
dependencies in the short term, however, next semester when we wish to
update the information, we have to scrap IVLE once again, so the only
condition is that IVLE has to be updated and there are no major changes
to the URL structure.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
</p><p>For the next sprint, we will working on the following three features:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Beautifying the UI of the android app</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Tidying up the code (currently most of the code is hacked
together)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Share on facebook/twitter functionality</p>

<div class="section" id="user-stories">
<h2>User Stories</h2>
</p><p>1) A year 3 student at NUS, who has only 4 semesters left, must quickly
figure out which remaining module is the most &quot;deeply nested&quot; so he can
clear all its prerequisites before the final semester and graduate on
time.</p>
<p>2) A year 1 student at NUS wants to identify which core modules he is
eligible to take next semester.</p>
<p>3) A year 2 student is discussing with her friends over lunch on what
module they should take next semester and wants to quickly find out the
prerequisite for a certain module.</p>

<div class="section" id="tech-stack">
<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
</p><p>GAE/Python for website - Requirement for Vostok Level, greater level of
support available</p>
<p>Android for mobile app - Possess hardware required for development,
easier to distribute final product</p>
<p>ndb - Querying datastore faster and simpler then external db. ndb
provides better caching which would be useful since only a small portion
of the 10000+ modules will be accessed frequently.</p>
<p>Rest - Simple. Port 80 is always open since it is used for HTTP. Easy to
cache. Module information is available publicly for anyone to access, no
security concerns</p>
